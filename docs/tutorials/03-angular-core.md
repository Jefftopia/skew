# Tutorial 3 — Versioned stores, the Angular way

**Package:** `@braidlabs/angular-core` · **Time:** ~20 minutes ·
**Prerequisites:** Tutorial 1, and an Angular 17+ app (the demo uses
standalone components, Signals, and `inject()`; no NgModules anywhere).

`@braidlabs/skew` is framework-free. This package is the thin, honest bridge to
Angular: a versioned store provided through DI, and a Signal wrapper that
reads it without flicker and without ever throwing at a component. You will
build a draft editor that survives a schema change *and* a reload — the demo's
remote editor, reduced to its essentials.

```sh
npm install @braidlabs/skew @braidlabs/angular-core
```

---

## Step 1 — The schema (from Tutorial 1)

Contracts live in one file, exported once, imported everywhere. If two parts
of your app declare the same contract separately, they *will* drift:

```ts
// src/app/domain.ts
import { versioned } from '@braidlabs/skew';

/** v1, frozen. Never edited again. */
interface DraftV1 {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  author: string;
  body: string;
}

export interface DraftV2 {
  id: string;
  title: string;
  author: { name: string; email: string };
  body: string;
  summary: string;
}

export const DraftSchema = versioned<DraftV1>('draft').next<DraftV2>(
  'structure the author and derive a summary',
  {
    up: (v1) => ({
      id: v1.id,
      title: v1.title,
      author: { name: v1.author, email: '' },
      body: v1.body,
      summary: v1.body.slice(0, 60),
    }),
    down: (v2) => ({
      id: v2.id,
      title: v2.title,
      author: v2.author.name,
      body: v2.body,
    }),
    derives: ['author.email', 'summary'],
    lossy: ['author.email', 'summary'],
  },
);

export const DRAFT_KEY = 'current';
```

---

## Step 2 — A token and a provider

A store is an injectable like any other — declared with a typed token,
provided once at the environment level:

```ts
// src/app/draft-store.ts
import { createSkewStoreToken } from '@braidlabs/angular-core';
import type { DraftV2 } from './domain';

export const DRAFT_STORE = createSkewStoreToken<DraftV2>('DRAFT_STORE');
```

```ts
// src/app/app.config.ts
import { ApplicationConfig } from '@angular/core';
import { webStorageDriver } from '@braidlabs/skew';
import { provideSkewStore } from '@braidlabs/angular-core';
import { DraftSchema } from './domain';
import { DRAFT_STORE } from './draft-store';
import { BUILD_ID } from '../generated/build-id';   // from Tutorial 2

export const appConfig: ApplicationConfig = {
  providers: [
    provideSkewStore(DRAFT_STORE, DraftSchema, {
      driver: webStorageDriver('local'),
      buildId: BUILD_ID,   // stamps envelopes, so a bad record names its writer
      onReadFailure: (key, failure) =>
        console.warn('[draft-store]', key, failure.reason, failure.message),
    }),
  ],
};
```

Why a token instead of injecting a concrete class: the token carries the
*payload type*, so every consumer gets a `VersionedStore<DraftV2>` without a
cast, and tests can provide the same token with a memory driver (step 5).

---

## Step 3 — Read it as a Signal

`injectSkewSignal` wraps one key of the store in three Signals plus two
verbs. The detail that separates it from a hand-rolled wrapper: it
synchronously **`peek()`s** the store first, so on `localStorage` the first
render already has data — no flash of empty state, no loading spinner for
sub-millisecond reads:

```ts
// src/app/draft-editor.ts
import { Component, inject } from '@angular/core';
import { injectSkewSignal } from '@braidlabs/angular-core';
import { DRAFT_STORE } from './draft-store';
import { DRAFT_KEY, type DraftV2 } from './domain';

@Component({
  selector: 'app-draft-editor',
  template: `
    @if (draft.loading()) {
      <p>Loading…</p>
    } @else if (draft.error(); as failure) {
      <div class="failure">
        <strong>Could not read the draft — {{ failure.reason }}</strong>
        @if (failure.reason === 'ahead') {
          <p>
            This draft was written by a newer deployment (v{{ failure.found }};
            this build understands v{{ failure.expected }}).
            The record is intact — it is this tab that is stale.
          </p>
          <button (click)="reloadApp()">Update this tab</button>
        } @else {
          <button (click)="draft.reload()">Try again</button>
        }
      </div>
    } @else if (draft.data(); as value) {
      <input
        [value]="value.title"
        (change)="rename(value, $any($event.target).value)"
      />
      <p>{{ value.author.name }} · {{ value.summary }}</p>
    } @else {
      <button (click)="create()">Start a draft</button>
    }
  `,
})
export class DraftEditor {
  protected readonly draft = injectSkewSignal(DRAFT_STORE, DRAFT_KEY);

  protected rename(current: DraftV2, title: string): void {
    // set() applies optimistically and persists through the schema —
    // the envelope, the version, the buildId all happen for free.
    void this.draft.set({ ...current, title });
  }

  protected create(): void {
    void this.draft.set({
      id: crypto.randomUUID(),
      title: 'Untitled',
      author: { name: 'You', email: '' },
      body: '',
      summary: '',
    });
  }

  protected reloadApp(): void {
    location.reload();
  }
}
```

What just happened, step by step:

1. On construction, the signal `peek()`ed synchronously. A v1 record written
   by *last month's build* migrated forward on the way out; the template
   never saw the old shape.
2. `draft.error()` is a typed `SkewErr | null` — the component branches on
   `reason` in the template, and the `ahead` branch gets its own honest UI
   instead of a generic "something went wrong".
3. `set()` updates the signal immediately and writes the envelope behind it.

This is the same pattern the demo's remote editor uses to read a record the
*host* build wrote — migrated at the boundary, once, instead of defensively
in every consumer:

---

## Step 4 — When you need the store itself

The signal covers one key. For imperative work — listing keys, deleting,
reading in an effect — inject the raw store through the same token:

```ts
import { injectSkewStore } from '@braidlabs/angular-core';

export class DraftAdmin {
  private readonly store = injectSkewStore(DRAFT_STORE);

  async discard(): Promise<void> {
    await this.store.remove(DRAFT_KEY);
  }

  async inspect(): Promise<void> {
    const result = await this.store.get(DRAFT_KEY);
    if (result.ok && result.migratedFrom) {
      console.log(
        `draft was written under v${result.migratedFrom}; ` +
          `guessed fields: ${result.derivedPaths.join(', ') || 'none'}`,
      );
    }
  }
}
```

Everything Tutorial 1 taught about results — `migratedFrom`,
`downgradedFrom`, `derivedPaths`, `lossyPaths` — flows through unchanged.
The Angular layer adds ergonomics, never semantics.

---

## Step 5 — Test with a memory driver

The token is the seam. Provide the same schema over `memoryDriver()` and the
whole component tree runs against an in-memory store — including the
migration path, which is the part worth testing:

```ts
import { TestBed } from '@angular/core/testing';
import { memoryDriver } from '@braidlabs/skew';
import { provideSkewStore } from '@braidlabs/angular-core';
import { DraftSchema, DRAFT_KEY } from './domain';
import { DRAFT_STORE } from './draft-store';

it('opens a v1 draft at the v2 shape', async () => {
  // Seed the driver with bytes exactly as an old build would have left them.
  const seed = new Map([
    [
      `draft:${DRAFT_KEY}`,
      JSON.stringify({
        v: 1,
        payload: { id: 'd1', title: 'T', author: 'Rev. Miller', body: 'B' },
      }),
    ],
  ]);

  TestBed.configureTestingModule({
    providers: [
      provideSkewStore(DRAFT_STORE, DraftSchema, { driver: memoryDriver(seed) }),
    ],
  });

  const store = TestBed.inject(DRAFT_STORE);
  const result = await store.get(DRAFT_KEY);

  expect(result.ok).toBe(true);
  if (result.ok) {
    expect(result.value.author).toEqual({ name: 'Rev. Miller', email: '' });
    expect(result.migratedFrom).toBe(1);
  }
});
```

Note what the seed is: the literal *bytes on disk*, envelope and all. Tests
that seed through `store.set()` only ever test the current version reading
itself — the case that never breaks.

---

## What you built

A draft editor that opens month-old records at today's shape, renders
failures as typed states instead of blank screens, never flickers on load,
and tests its own migration path against real stored bytes.

the data that lives on a server instead of in a store.
