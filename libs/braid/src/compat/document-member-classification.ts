/**
 * Classification of the Document API surface for compat fragment contexts (the WebIDL audit
 * manifest, M2 in the monkey-patch ledger).
 *
 * Every entry records the result of auditing a Document member for use by application code
 * running inside a compat fragment:
 *
 * - `'virtualized'` — the member is reimplemented by the document facade (see
 *   `document-overrides.ts`) so that it operates on the fragment's DOM in the main document
 *   (shadow root / `<braid-document>`) instead of the fragment's hidden realm iframe document.
 *
 * - `'native'` — the member was audited and the realm document's native behavior is the desired
 *   behavior for fragments, so it intentionally passes through the facade untouched.
 *
 * Spec-defined Document members absent from this map have not been audited yet. They pass
 * through to the realm document's native behavior, and the facade logs a dev-mode diagnostic
 * when a fragment uses them, so unaudited API usage surfaces during development instead of
 * failing silently — and feeds the compat fidelity telemetry the architecture calls for.
 *
 * Members inherited from Node and EventTarget always pass through silently — DOM tree traversal
 * and event dispatch are virtualized at other layers (the fragment boundary and the event
 * system patches in `realm-patches.ts`).
 *
 * Note: `location` is a [LegacyUnforgeable] own property of the document instance and can never
 * be intercepted via the prototype chain, so it is intentionally not classified here. The compat
 * realm iframe's `src` is set to the fragment's url, which makes the realm's native
 * `document.location` correct for fragments.
