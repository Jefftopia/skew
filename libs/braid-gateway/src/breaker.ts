/**
 * A per-fragment circuit breaker.
 *
 * **The problem it solves is compounding, not failure.** A fragment endpoint that is down already
 * costs its full `timeoutMs` — but it costs that on *every* request, because nothing remembers the
 * last one. Four fragments at a 3s budget means a page held hostage to the worst of them, over and
 * over, with the shell's own response waiting behind it. The fallback machinery already handles a
 * fragment that fails; what it cannot do is stop paying to rediscover that it fails.
 *
 * So the breaker's job is to convert a slow, repeated failure into a fast, cheap one. It is a
 * latency control first and an availability control second.
 *
 * Deliberately per fragment id, never global: fragments are independently deployed, and one team's
 * bad release must not open a circuit in front of another team's healthy app.
