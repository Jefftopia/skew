/**
 * The durable mutation outbox, as an Angular service over `@braidlabs/data`.
 *
 * This is the piece that cannot be built with in-flight request machinery. A mutation queued while
 * offline has to survive a page reload — and after a reload there is no pending `Promise` to retry,
 * no `HttpRequest` to intercept, and no closure left alive. Only something persisted can be
 * replayed.
 *
 * Which forces one API constraint: an outbox mutation must have a stable `id`, because the
 * *operation* is a closure and closures do not serialise. On replay we look the operation up by id.
 *
 * **The store is shared and the entries are owned.** Persistence lives in `@braidlabs/data`, one
 * record per entry, in a store every app on the origin reads. This service replays only what it
 * owns. Previously the queue was a single blob under one key, so a second app overwrote the first's
 * and then dropped its entries for having no registered runner — silently, unless `onOutboxError`
 * happened to be wired.
