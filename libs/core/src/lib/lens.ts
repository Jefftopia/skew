/**
 * Declarative migration ops — the data-driven alternative to closure
 * migrations.
 *
 * A closure can express any migration but can only travel inside the bundle
 * that compiled it. An ops list is data: it can be published by an API,
 * fetched by a build that has never seen the newer shape, audited by a human,
 * and — because every op is structural — **mechanically inverted**, so
 * declaring the up-migration buys the down-migration for free.
 *
 * The op set is deliberately closed and non-Turing-complete. Nothing fetched
 * over the network is ever executed as code; it is interpreted, op by op,
 * against a whitelist. Semantic transforms ("split this name into first and
 * last") do not belong here — they stay as named code steps, and a reader
 * that lacks the named function degrades loudly rather than guessing.
 *
 * Directionality: ops describe the **up** migration (older shape → newer
 * shape). The inverse of each op, where one exists, is derived:
 *
 * | op        | up (old → new)                          | down (new → old)                     |
 * | --------- | --------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------ |
 * | `rename`  | move value `from` → `to`                | move value `to` → `from`             |
 * | `move`    | alias of `rename`                       | reversed                             |
 * | `wrap`    | scalar → `{ [key]: scalar, ...also }`   | object → its `[key]`; `also` dropped |
 * | `hoist`   | object → its `[key]` member             | `[key]` re-wrapped (siblings lost)   |
 * | `map`     | sub-ops over each array element         | inverted sub-ops, reversed           |
 * | `default` | set `path` when absent                  | delete `path` (lossy)                |
 * | `drop`    | delete `path`                           | set `restore` if given, else none    |
 * | `convert` | coerce / map the value at `path`        | opposite coercion / inverted map     |
 * | `const`   | set `path` unconditionally              | delete `path` (lossy)                |
