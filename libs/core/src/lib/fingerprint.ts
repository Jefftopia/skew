/**
 * Content fingerprints for schemas and their steps.
 *
 * Two independently built bundles can declare a chain under the same contract
 * name. When their declarations *agree*, that duplication is harmless; when
 * they disagree — same name, same version numbers, different meaning — the
 * result is the silent kind of corruption nothing else in the system can see.
 * A fingerprint makes "do these two declarations agree?" a cheap, answerable
 * question.
 *
 * What goes into a step's fingerprint is deliberate:
 *
 * - For an ops step, the canonical JSON of the ops — the ops *are* the
 *   migration, so structural equality is real equality.
 * - For a code step, the target version and the (required) description — and
 *   **not** `Function.prototype.toString()`. Two builds minify the same source
 *   differently, so function text equality would report false conflicts
 *   between builds that genuinely agree. The description is the human-owned
 *   identity of a code step; that is one of the reasons it is required.
