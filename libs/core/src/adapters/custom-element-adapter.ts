/**
 * The custom-element adapter — a fragment that ships an ordinary custom element.
 *
 * This is contract-mode: no document facade, no window patches, no boundary stamping. A
 * well-behaved custom element does not need to believe it owns the browser; it needs a mount
 * point, its props, and a teardown signal — which is exactly what `FragmentEnv` provides. The
 * whole adapter is the code below.
 *
 * **How the element gets into the host page.** Custom element registries are per-window, so an
 * element defined in the fragment's realm only upgrades elements created by *that* realm's
 * document. So the element is created in the realm — where it upgrades against the fragment's
 * own definition — and then moved into the host's DOM. Adoption preserves the element's class
 * and behavior (the spec calls `adoptedCallback` and the instance keeps its definition), which
 * is what lets a fragment's element live in the host page while its code stays isolated.
 *
 * The isolation this buys is real: two fragments may define the same tag name differently, or
 * ship different majors of the same component library, and nothing collides — each definition
 * lives in its own registry.
