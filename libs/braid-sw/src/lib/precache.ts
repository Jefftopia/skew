 * Realm stub precaching: a fragment boot with no round trip in it.

 * A realm stub is the tiny document a fragment's realm is created from. They are identical per URL
 * and vary on nothing — which is what the protocol's path split bought — so they are the one thing
 * in this system that can be fetched before anybody asks for it without guessing.
 *
 * Kept deliberately small in scope: stubs only. Precaching a fragment's *application* bundles would
 * mean downloading every fragment on the origin whether or not the user ever visits a page that
 * composes them, which trades a round trip the user might make for bandwidth they certainly spend.
