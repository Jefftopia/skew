/**
 * Skew-aware asset serving: the one layer that can keep an open page working after a deploy.
 *
 * The failure this exists for is the classic micro-frontend white screen. A user has the page open,
 * a deploy lands, they click something that lazy-loads `main.abc123.js` — and it is gone from the
 * origin, because the new build wrote `main.def456.js` instead. Nothing on the page can recover:
 * the request is made by the module loader, the response is a 404, and the route dies.
 *
 * A service worker can, because it saw that chunk go past on the way in and kept a copy.
 *
 * **Braid makes this materially cleaner than it is for a monolith.** Every fragment's assets live
 * under `/__braid/frag/:id/*`, so each fragment gets its own cache partition keyed by its own build.
 * Fragment A at build 5 and fragment B at build 12 coexist with no shared cache generation to
 * invalidate — a monolith's worker has one bucket and one answer for the whole page.
 *
 * Scope discipline: this handler answers for the Braid namespace and returns `null` for everything
 * else. A shell composing it into its own worker keeps ownership of its own routes, and a shell
 * using the prebuilt worker gets a worker that does nothing surprising to the rest of its origin.
