/**
 * The composition topology of a gateway, derived from a discovery listing.
 *
 * **Why this is not a dependency graph.** Fragments do not import each other — that is the
 * property the whole composition layer exists to provide, and a graph drawing `billing → reviews`
 * edges would be drawing relationships that provably do not exist. What *does* relate fragments is
 * where they compose and what serves them:
 *
 * - a **route** pierces one or more fragments into a page, so fragments sharing a route share a
 *   document, a viewport, and a failure blast radius;
 * - an **origin** serves one or more fragments, so fragments sharing an origin share a deploy.
 *
 * Those are the two real coupling surfaces, and both are already in the listing. Co-occupancy on a
 * route is the same condition the registry's overlap findings warn about, which is why selecting a
 * route here is the visual form of that warning rather than a second opinion about it.
 *
 * Everything is derived from `DiscoveryEntry` alone: no new gateway endpoint, and a production
 * listing that withholds endpoints simply yields a graph without the origin column.
