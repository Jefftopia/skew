 * - **Strictly sequential.** Queued writes routinely depend on each other — create a thing, then
 *   rename the thing — and replaying them in parallel races them into the wrong order.
 * - **A failure stops the drain** rather than skipping ahead, for the same reason.
 * - **A permanently failing entry is abandoned loudly.** The user navigated away believing it saved,
 *   so its disappearance has to be reported to someone who can act on it.
 * - **An entry with no runner is kept, not dropped.** It means the app did not re-register that
 *   mutation kind at start-up, or renamed it between deploys — and dropping it discards a write the
 *   user was told had succeeded. Keeping it means a later build (or a rollback) can still send it,
 *   and `outbox.remove` is there for an operator who decides otherwise.
