 * decision below:
 *
 * 1. **The cache is shared across applications**, because it lives in storage rather than in one
 *    app's memory. Two independently deployed apps asking for the same record fetch it once
 *    between them.
 * 2. **Records are projected per reader.** The store holds what the writer wrote; each reader
 *    migrates it to its own contract version on the way out, in either direction.
 * 3. **Provenance travels with the value.** A reader can tell a field the server reported from one
 *    a migration guessed, which is the entire reason to build on the migration engine rather than
 *    on a plain cache.
 *
 * A fourth follows from the outbox: **the optimistic view is derived, never stored.**
 *
 *     view(record) = confirmed(record) ⊕ pending(record)
 *
 * Both inputs are shared, so every app and every tab derives the same view without reconciling
 * anything, rollback is deletion rather than an undo record to keep consistent, and the queue and
 * the overlay cannot disagree because they are one thing.
