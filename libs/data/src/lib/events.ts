/**
 * Eventing across independently deployed applications: channels, durable queues, and conflict.
 *
 * This lives in `@skewkit/data` rather than in Braid because none of it is about composition — it is
 * about a queue, a lock, and a versioned payload, which is what this package already is. A Module
 * Federation deployment with no Braid at all should be able to use it, and Braid's context bus should
 * be able to sit on top rather than beside it.
 *
 * **Almost nothing here is new.** Durability is the outbox, one record per entry. Draining is
 * `drainOutbox`, with its ordering, its cross-context lock, and its give-up rule. Waking another
 * realm is the invalidator. Surviving version skew is `versioned()`. The parts that are genuinely
 * new are the two decisions below.
 *
 * **1. State is not an event.** FDC3 conflates them: `broadcast` sets a channel's current context
 * *and* replays it to late joiners, so it means both "this happened" and "this is now true". That
 * works for a selected row and fails for anything with a verb. Here `broadcast`/`state` is the
 * former and `emit`/`addEventListener` is the latter.
 *
 * **2. Durable fan-out is one queue per consumer, not one queue with acknowledgements.** An
 * at-least-once event is written once per registered consumer, into that consumer's own queue, and
 * *deletion on success is the acknowledgement*. It costs N copies of the payload and buys three
 * things: no new storage shape, no ack bookkeeping to keep consistent, and — the one that matters —
 * a consumer whose handler keeps failing blocks only itself. A shared entry with an ack set gives
 * every consumer the same head-of-line blocking.
