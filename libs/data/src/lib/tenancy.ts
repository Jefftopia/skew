/**
 * Tenancy: which partition is live, and what sign-out actually destroys.
 *
 * Two identities change independently and both belong in the key:
 *
 * - the **authentication principal** — who is signed in; changing it is a login
 * - the **acting-as tenant** — whose data is being viewed; changing it is a switch
 *
 *     partition = hash(userId, actingAs)
 *
 * `actingAs` is part of the key rather than a dimension inside it. The cost is real — genuinely
 * shared reference data is fetched once per tenant instead of once — and it buys the property that
 * makes persistence-first defensible: a partition is **fully self-contained**. No read crosses a
 * tenant boundary, so switching is a pointer move, purge is complete by construction, and there is
 * no shared slice whose lifetime has to be reasoned about apart from the partitions referencing it.
 *
 * **Encryption at rest is deliberately not here.** A browser key has to live somewhere, and a
 * non-extractable `CryptoKey` in IndexedDB defends against casual inspection but not against code
 * running on the origin — which, on a page composing several fragments, is the realistic threat.
 * Purge-on-sign-out is the honest control; encryption beside it would be theatre.
