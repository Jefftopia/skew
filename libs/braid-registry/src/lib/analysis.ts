 * changed line.
 *
 * **This is a heuristic.** `URLPattern` exposes no intersection operation, so overlap is probed:
 * each pattern is reduced to a concrete sample path by filling wildcards and named groups with a
 * sentinel segment, and every sample is tested against every other pattern. That catches the cases
 * that occur in practice (a prefix wildcard swallowing a sibling route, duplicated patterns) and
 * will miss exotic ones — patterns that intersect only on inputs the sentinel does not generate,
 * such as two disjoint regex groups.
